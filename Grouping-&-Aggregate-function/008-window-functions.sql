SELECT booking_date, amount_tipped, SUM(amount_tipped) OVER (PARTITION BY booking_date) FROM bookings;-- This query calculates the total amount tipped for each booking date using a window function. The SUM() function is used as a window function with the OVER() clause, which allows us to perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row without collapsing the result set into a single row per group. The PARTITION BY clause specifies that the calculation should be done for each unique booking_date.
